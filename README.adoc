`ttdrill` a simple drill script for targeting special characters when training touch-typing.

----
ttdrill --source abcdf
----

Will generate random strings with the characters provided (In this case, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` and `f`).
You should then type the string generated.
If you type the string correctly a longer string will be produced.

If you fail to type the string the next string generated will be shorter and the character you missed will have a higher chance of showing up in the subsequent generated strings.
If the character you mistakenly typed is also included in the source string then it will also have a higher chance of showing up in subsequent generated strings.

If you don't provide a start screen a default string with numbers and a few signs will be used.
